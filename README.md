# Reinforced-Concrete-Columns-Shear-Strength-Prediction-System
This project develops an integrated framework for RC column seismic performance prediction. It uses a two-stage ML model (classify-then-regress) to achieve high accuracy (RÂ²>0.96). A user-friendly GUI is developed for practical engineering use, enhancing both prediction accuracy and model transparency.
